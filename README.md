# Prediction-of-RainFall-in-Australia
 ## Problem Statement :
   We will be predicting the rainfall in Australia with the help of certain features like WindSpeed, Humidity, Evaporation, RainFall, etc.
  
  
I have used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree with Hyperparameter Tuning and k-Nearest Neighbours(kNN) alogorithms to develop the model and the data has been extracted from the kaggle.
